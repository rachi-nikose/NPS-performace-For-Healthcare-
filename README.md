## What is NPS (Net Promoter Score)?

## NPS stands for Net Promoter Score. It's a widely used management tool that measures customer loyalty and satisfaction. 
In this context, it specifically measures how likely patients are to recommend the therapy they're receiving to someone they know, on a scale from 0 to 10. It's calculated by taking the percentage of 'promoters' and subtracting the percentage of 'detractors'.


## Promoters: These are your most enthusiastic patients, giving a score of 9 or 10. They are highly satisfied and likely to recommend the therapy, driving positive word-of-mouth.
Detractors: These are unhappy patients, giving a score of 0 to 6. They are unlikely to recommend and may even spread negative feedback.
(Implicitly, scores of 7 and 8 are 'Passives' â€“ satisfied but not enthusiastic, and not included in the direct NPS calculation.)
Why Does NPS Matter to a Healthcare Company?

For a healthcare company, NPS is a vital metric because:

## Patient Retention and Growth: High NPS indicates satisfied patients who are more likely to continue therapy and refer new patients. In healthcare, referrals are a significant source of new patients.
Quality of Care Indicator: A strong NPS suggests that the therapy is effective and the patient experience is positive.
Early Warning System: A declining NPS can signal underlying issues with the therapy, patient support, or overall service, allowing the company to address them proactively.
Competitive Advantage: Companies with higher NPS often outperform competitors due to stronger patient loyalty and reputation.
The Business Problem We Were Solving:

## The core business problem was the need to closely monitor and supervise patient satisfaction with their therapy over time, using NPS as a key indicator. The company needed a structured way to:

Consistently calculate NPS on a monthly basis.
Understand the trends in patient satisfaction.
Identify periods of declining satisfaction to investigate root causes.
Ultimately, use these insights to improve the overall patient experience and the effectiveness of the therapy.
